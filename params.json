Unfortunately it didn't work on recent jQuery (UI) versions. So I decided to fork and improve it by:\r\n\r\n- Making it compatible with recent jQuery and jQuery UI versions (> 1.10)\r\n- Better directory-structure\r\n- Adding bower support\r\n\r\nI'm planning to add installation instructions and some demo's here in the future.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
