JQuery Collision

INSTALLATION

- Copy jquery-ui-draggable-collision.js or any specific or minified version of jquery-ui-draggable-collision(-x.x.x)(.min).js into your javascript directory
- Make sure that jquery 1.5.1 or later is somewhere accessible
- Make sure that jqueryui 1.8.12 or later is somewhere accessible
- Make sure that jquery-collision 1.0.0 or later is somewhere accessible
- Load jquery-ui-draggable-collision and its dependencies:
  <script src="jquery-1.5.1.js"></script>
  <script src="ui/jquery.ui.core.js"></script>
  <script src="ui/jquery.ui.widget.js"></script>
  <script src="ui/jquery.ui.mouse.js"></script>
  <script src="ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js"></script>
  <script src="jquery-collision-1.0.0.js"></script>
  <script src="jquery-ui-draggable-collision-1.0.0.js"></script>
- After that, there are several new features available for $(selector).draggable(), and 6 new events for $(selector).bind()

ACTIVATION

- In order for any of the features of JQuery UI Draggable Collision to work, including the new events, one or more of the following
  options must be used during the draggable plugin setup for a given selector:

  $(selector).draggable( { obstacle: some_obstacle_selector } )

  $(selector).draggable( { restraint: some_obstacle_selector } )

  $(selector).draggable( { multipleCollisionInteractions: [ /* list of sets of options, see below */ ] } )

EVENTS

- precollision

  If there are any obstacles listed, all colliders that have obstacles get a precollision event at each drag step (start, drag, and stop)
  just before the actual collision-detection is done. The reason for the PRE-collision event is in case you need to make adjustments to
  the ui or event variable, or anything else, right before the collisions are calculated. 

  event.collider = the individual collider being checked for collision
  
  event.obstacle = the individual obstacle being checked for collision

  event.collisionType = "collision" or "protrusion"

- preprotrusion

  If any colliders have restraints listed, they get the same kind of event as precollision above. Same event data available.

- postcollision

  Same as precollision, but after the collision-detection and events, for each drag step (start, drag, and stop).

- postprotrusion

  Same as postcollision, but for colliders with protrusions.

- collision

  
OPTIONS


CARRY-OVER OPTIONS

Some options have been carried over from jquery-collision, and affect all collisions during the dragging process

- relative: "body", "collider", "obstacle", or any selector

  The event.collision object will be relative to this, in the same way that jquery-collision works.

- colliderData: "some_string"

  Somewhat redundant, since event.collider contains this info, but this places the $(collider) in $(collision).data("some_string")

- obstacleData: "some_string"

  Somewhat redundant, since event.obstacle contains this info, but this places the $(obstacle) in $(collision).data("some_string")

- directionData: "some_string"

  This places the direction information in $(collision).data("some_string"). See jquery-collision for more details.

- NOTE: "as" has not been carried over - it is always a "<div />"

- NOTE: "mode" has not been carried over - it is set by using "obstacle" and "restraint"

EXAMPLES

- Make sure that jquery-ui-draggable-collision.js, jquery-collision.js, jquery-1.5.1.js and ui/jquery.ui.*.js are in the same directory as the examples
- Load the examples up in a browser
